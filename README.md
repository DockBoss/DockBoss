### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Im a new developer in the process of self teaching the skills I will need for my profeshion.

Where I am learning
- Free Code Camp
- Stack Overflow
- W3Schools
- Youtube

What I am working on
- Free Code Camp Responsive web design projects
- Free Code Camp JavaScript algrothim projects
- My personal portfolio
- Company website
- Small projects to fill my portfolio

My Goals
- Create my own web and phone apps that not only look great but are useful to the everyday user
- Make enough money from my projects or other jobs to be a full time full stack dev
- be happy

My projects are not the best at the moment, but if you check back every once in a while you will be able to see improvement (maybe enough improvement for a job or internship wink wink)
